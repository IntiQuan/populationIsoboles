Description: This package provides an algorithm to efficiently calculate 
  isoboles, given a dose-response model. Furthermore, a vignette is provided
  to show how population simulation and isoboles can be combined to 
  obtain confidence level response surfaces of NLME models quickly.
  If you are interested in the fast isoboles algorithm, take a look at the
  examples of ?grid_refinement.
  If you want to calculate confidence level response surfaces, take a look
  at vignette("Population-Isoboles") for a generic example.
